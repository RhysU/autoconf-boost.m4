Build Procedure
===============

Introduction
------------

This document describes how to build this source code on Unix-like systems.


Dependencies
------------

The code depends upon the following libraries:

 1. Boost from http://www.boost.org/


Configuration
-------------

If you have no `configure` script in the top level directory, run `bootstrap`
to create one using GNU autoconf and automake.  Using bootstrap will require a
recent version of these tools.

Before compiling, you need to run the provided `configure` script.  Generally,
just `./configure` will work, but you may wish to provide more parameters.  Run
`./configure --help` for details.


Compilation
-----------

To compile this code after it has been configured, simply type `make`.
Afterwards one or more ready-to-use executables should reside in the src
subdirectory.


Testing
-------

Unit tests can be compiled and run using 'make check'.
